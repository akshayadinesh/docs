### 1. Go to Settings

Navigate to the [Settings](https://app.spellbound.io/dashboard/settings) tab in Spellbound and click "Add Sending Domain" to create a new sending domain.

### 2. Copy the DNS records into your DNS provider.

Make sure you don't include your domain twice when you add the CNAME records. Some DNS providers will automatically remove the domain, and some need you to include it.

### 3. Verify the records have applied.

Click "Check Status" to see if your records have propagated. It may take up a few minutes to apply, so be patient. If you're still not seeing all green check marks after a few hours, you may have a mistake with your DNS records and feel free to reach out to help@spellbound.io and we'd be happy to help you debug.
