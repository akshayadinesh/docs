## Gmail & Yahoo Mail

Gmail and Yahoo Mail support interactive emails across most devices and app versions. However, there is a whitelisting process for both of these clients that kicks off once you connect a custom domain to Spellbound. We take care of the whitelisting process for you, which takes ~1 day for Yahoo Mail and 1-2 weeks for Gmail before you get approved. The whitelist happens for Gmail _per sending email address_, so you must use one of your approved emails to send emails if you want your emails to show up as interactive in Gmail. To request a new email address for whitelisting, reach out to us!

### Testing in dev mode on Gmail

While you're waiting for your sending email address to get approved by Gmail, you can still test the interactivity in your Gmail
