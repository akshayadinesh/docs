<Note>
  Before you can use the Spellbound API to send emails, you'll need to follow
  our steps for setting up a custom domain and grab your API Key from the
  Settings tab.
</Note>

## Base URL

The base URL for the Spellbound API is simply https://api.spellbound.io. We're currently on v1, so a sample API endpoint would be https://api.spellbound.io/v1/emails/send.

## Headers

All API calls need two headers: Content-Type and Authorization.

```
{
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOURAPIKEY"
  }
```

## Authentication

To grab your API key, first make sure you've followed the instructions [here](https://spellbound.io/docs/domain-setup) to add a valid custom domain to Spellbound. Once you have, you can go to the [Settings](https://app.spellbound.io/dashboard/settings) page to grab your API Key.
